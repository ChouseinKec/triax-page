![Triax Page Builder Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Triax is an extensible page builder for React, designed to provide a complete visual editing experience‚Äîincluding a block editor, style editor, and logic editor. The current focus is on the advanced style editor and foundational block editor, with a roadmap toward a full-featured, production-ready builder.

## üñºÔ∏è Application Layout

Triax uses a **panel-based layout**. Each panel is responsible for a specific part of the editing experience, and components can assign their own controls or even their own sections.

**Main Panels:**
- **Blocks Panel:** Add new blocks to the page. Provides a searchable, categorized list of all available blocks.
- **Inspector Panel:** Manage block settings, including attributes and style values. Edit the details of the selected block.
- **Action Panel:** Each block can register its own controls here (e.g., order, rename, or any block-specific actions). This panel is context-aware and adapts to the selected block.

**Panel Layout Features:**
- Each panel can be **dragged** and **resized** from any corner or side.
- Panels can be **locked in place** to prevent accidental movement or resizing.
- *(Planned)* Ability to **save and load custom layouts**, enabling users to create and switch between personalized workspace arrangements.

This modular and flexible panel system makes the editor highly extensible and customizable for different workflows and plugins.
