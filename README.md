> 🚀 **Ambitious, extensible page builder for React**

Triax Page is an ambitious, extensible page builder for React, designed to provide a complete visual editing experience—including a block editor, style editor, and logic editor. While the long-term goal is a full-featured page builder, the current focus is on the advanced style editor and foundational block editor.
